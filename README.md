## About

A set of [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) modules that manage my machines. It's like Configuration as Code for your dotfiles, but taken to an extreme. This repo manages my primary dev machine (NixOS/Linux), a few macOS devices with [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/), some WSL2 environments, and a tremendous amount of cross-platform configuration between them with [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
