# Plugin Nursery
One of my few joys is writing vim plugins, but it takes a while before a plugin idea is robust. I use this directory to experiment with ideas and create one-off utilities. If they prove useful enough, I pull them into separate repositories.

Each directory is it's own plugin. Feel free to copy anything to looks interesting, but be warned that it's mostly alpha quality.
