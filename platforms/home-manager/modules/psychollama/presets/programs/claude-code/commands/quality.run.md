Time to execute the quality improvement plan!

1. Create and check out a new branch named `quality/<short-description>` based on the improvements
2. Commit the plan file (`ref/improvements.md`) with message "Add quality improvement plan"
3. Work through each ticket in `ref/improvements.md`:
   - Implement the improvement
   - Commit with a descriptive message referencing the ticket
   - Mark the ticket as complete in the improvements file
   - Repeat until all tickets are done
4. Push the branch when finished

Ask any clarifying questions before starting.
